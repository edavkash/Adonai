# Neovim setup 
This configuration work best for (pwsh) powershell and should be cloned at the AppData/Local directory, but  if you are a mac or Linux user I will recommend you to create .config directory and then clone it their. 

# windowa

1.git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git $env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim

# macos & linux

1.mkdir -p ~/.config
2.git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git ~/.config/nvim

# a little tip

1.The colorscheme
I am using the kanagawa colorscheme, but if you prefer you could change directory from the plugins <dir> to the colorscheme <dir> and pick a colorscheme of your choice don't forget to check the setting.lua file in the lua directory and uncomment or replace the scheme/theme with your preferred one. 

Here is the link to other colorscheme you might be interested in head here https://github.com/topics/neovim-colorscheme

# thank you
